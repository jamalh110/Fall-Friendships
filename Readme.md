# What is this?
Fall friendships is a service that pairs Cornell students (primarily targeting first years or transfers) with a groups of friends to ease their transition to Cornell by having a squad of friends to turn to. The pairings are based on a detailed survey with questions pertaining to personality and other aspects imporant for strong friendships, which we then run through our internal machine learning algorithm to form groups of 3-4

The idea for this stemmed from Perfect Match, which I created last spring to match Cornell Students for blind dates. That service had over 4,000 participants, and you can check it out here: http://www.perfectmatch2019.com/demonstration
