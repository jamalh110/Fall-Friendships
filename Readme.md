# What is this?
Fall friendships is a service that pairs Cornell students (primarily targeting first years or transfers) with a groups of friends to ease their transition to Cornell by having a squad of friends to turn to. The pairings are based on a detailed survey with questions pertaining to personality and other aspects imporant for strong friendships, which we then run through our internal machine learning algorithm to form groups of 3-4.
